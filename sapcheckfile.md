To design and architect a solution for migrating SAP from on-premises to Azure, I need the following information from the client and SAP team to ensure a tailored, efficient, and compliant migration. This is based on Azure best practices for SAP workloads and the provided context:

1. Operational and SAP Application Details
SAP Applications and Modules:
Which SAP applications are in use (e.g., SAP ERP Central Component (ECC), S/4HANA, BW/4HANA, CRM, SRM)?
Specific ERP modules deployed (e.g., FI, CO, MM, SD, PP, HCM, PM, QM)?
Any non-SAP applications integrated with the SAP landscape (e.g., third-party tools for MM or SD)?
SAP Version and Upgrade Plans:
Current SAP release version (e.g., ECC 6.0, S/4HANA 2023)?
Plans to upgrade to a newer version (e.g., S/4HANA) during migration?
Workloads and Usage:
Peak usage patterns (e.g., number of concurrent users per module, batch job schedules)?
Performance requirements (e.g., transaction response times for SD, batch processing windows for PP)?
High Availability (HA) or Disaster Recovery (DR) requirements for specific modules (e.g., FI for financial reporting)?
Database Details:
Current database platform (e.g., SAP HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2)?
Database sizes for each SAP system (e.g., production, development, QA)?
Specific database performance requirements (e.g., IOPS for HANA-based PP)?
2. Current Infrastructure
On-Premises Infrastructure:
Hardware configuration for each SAP system (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage for production, non-production)?
Operating system and version (e.g., Windows, Linux, AIX)?
Storage type and capacity (e.g., SAN, NAS)?
Virtualization platforms in use (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V)?
Network:
Current network topology (e.g., bandwidth, latency between data centers)?
Network security requirements (e.g., firewalls for FI data, VPNs for SD transactions)?
High Availability and Disaster Recovery:
Current HA/DR configurations (e.g., clustering for FI, replication for MM)?
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each system?
3. Backup and Data Retention
Backup Strategy:
Current backup strategy for modules (e.g., frequency, full vs. incremental for FI, SD)?
Retention policies for backups (e.g., daily for SD, monthly for FI)?
Compliance requirements for data retention (e.g., GDPR for HCM)?
Backup Tools:
Tools used for backups (e.g., SAP Backup for HANA, third-party tools like Commvault)?
Preference for Azure-native backup solutions (e.g., Azure Backup)?
4. Monitoring and Management
Monitoring Tools:
Tools used for SAP and infrastructure monitoring (e.g., SAP Solution Manager, Nagios)?
Specific monitoring requirements (e.g., real-time alerts for SD, performance metrics for PP)?
Management:
Who manages the current SAP infrastructure (e.g., in-house team, managed service provider)?
Preference for managed services in Azure (e.g., Azure Monitor, SAP on Azure managed services)?
5. Network and Security
Network Requirements:
Connectivity needs between on-premises and Azure (e.g., ExpressRoute for MM inventory sync)?
Latency or bandwidth requirements for modules (e.g., SD, PP)?
Security and Compliance:
Security requirements (e.g., encryption for FI data, identity management for HCM)?
Industry-specific compliance needs (e.g., GDPR for HCM, SOX for FI/CO)?
Requirements for Azure-specific security features (e.g., Azure Security Center, Azure Key Vault for SSO)?
6. Financial Considerations
Budget:
Budget for the migration project and ongoing Azure operations?
Preference for reserved instances or pay-as-you-go pricing?
Cost Optimization:
Specific cost optimization goals (e.g., leveraging Azure Hybrid Benefit)?
Need for detailed cost estimation using Azure Pricing Calculator?
7. Future-State and Strategic Goals
Migration Goals:
Type of migration: greenfield (new implementation), brownfield (system conversion), or lift-and-shift (rehost)?
Plans to leverage Azure-specific features (e.g., AI for PP forecasting, analytics for SD)?
Scalability and Growth:
Expected growth projections for SAP workloads (e.g., user growth in SD, data growth in FI)?
Plans to adopt cloud-native architectures (e.g., microservices for MM integrations)?
Timeline:
Desired timeline for migration?
Specific milestones or phases (e.g., pilot for SD, production for FI/CO)?
8. Additional Context
Current Pain Points:
Any specific issues with the current on-premises setup (e.g., performance bottlenecks, scalability limitations)?
Stakeholder Roles:
Key stakeholders (e.g., SAP Basis team, network/security specialists) and their roles in the migration?
Existing Azure Usage:
Any current use of Azure services or subscriptions that could be leveraged?
Licensing:
Details on existing SAP and database licenses (e.g., bring-your-own-license for Windows/SQL Server)?
How This Information Will Be Used
Sizing and Architecture: Map on-premises resources to Azure VM SKUs (e.g., M-Series for HANA, D-Series for app servers) using tools like SAP Quick Sizer, based on hardware, database, and workload data.
Network Design: Plan connectivity (e.g., ExpressRoute) and security (e.g., NSGs, Azure Firewall) based on network and security requirements.
HA/DR: Design HA/DR strategies (e.g., Azure Site Recovery, HANA System Replication) aligned with RTO/RPO needs.
Cost Estimation: Use Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate costs, incorporating reserved instances or Hybrid Benefit for cost optimization.
Migration Strategy: Choose the appropriate migration type (greenfield, brownfield, lift-and-shift) and tools (e.g., Azure Migrate, SAP Migration Factory) based on goals and timeline.
Compliance: Ensure alignment with standards (e.g., GDPR, SOX) using Azure Policy and Security Center.
Providing this information ensures the solution is optimized for performance, cost, scalability, and compliance, tailored to the clientâ€™s SAP landscape and strategic objectives. If any details are unclear, I can assist in gathering them through a questionnaire or discovery session.
