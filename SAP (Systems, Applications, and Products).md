### **General SAP Architecture**
Most SAP applications follow a **three-tier client-server architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Handles user interactions via SAP GUI, SAP Fiori, or web browsers.
   - Components: SAP Web Dispatcher (routes HTTP/HTTPS requests), SAP Fiori Launchpad.[](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_fiori/sap_fiori_architecture.htm)
2. **Application Layer**:
   - Processes business logic using ABAP or Java.
   - Components: ABAP Dispatcher (distributes workloads), Gateway (handles RFC/HTTP communication), ICM (manages internet protocols), and work processes for task execution.[](https://erpiseasy.com/2022/10/09/sap-abap-technical-architecture/)[](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw73ehp1/7.31.19/en-US/47/fe7aa040e23c8be10000000a42189c/content.htm?no_cache=true)
3. **Database Layer**:
   - Stores and manages data using SAP HANA or other databases (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server for older systems).
   - Supports client-dependent (MANDT field in tables) and client-independent data.[](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/sap_architecture.htm)

**Key Features**:
- **Scalability**: Multiple application server instances for load balancing.[](https://erpiseasy.com/2022/10/09/sap-abap-technical-architecture/)

### **Additional Notes**
- **Legacy Applications**: Older SAP products like SAP R/3, SAP ERP (ECC), SAP CRM, SCM, SRM, and PLM are being phased out in favor of S/4HANA and cloud-based solutions. Support for SAP ECC ends in 2030, pushing migrations to S/4HANA.[](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-architecture-what-s-different-in-azure/ba-p/13477711)
- **Customization**: SAP applications support extensive customization via ABAP, SAP BTP, and low-code platforms like SAP Build Apps.[](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/beginner-level-understanding-on-sap-btp-architecture/ba-p/13556122)
- **Industry-Specific Solutions**: SAP offers tailored solutions for industries like manufacturing, retail, and healthcare, built on the same architectural principles.
